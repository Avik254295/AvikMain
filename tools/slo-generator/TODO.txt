- Custom fields (owner, history, logs, maintainer)
- Add ability to pass custom backends code
- Add ability to sync timestamps across SLOs
- One scheduler could trigger all Cloud Functions
- Add YAML support
- Add compact example:

  **Note:** This module needs the `slo-pipeline` shared module to function
  properly. If you want an all-in-one SLO module (no need for shared
  infrastructure), see the [compact_example](../../examples/compact_example).

  **Note:**
  Splitting the `compute` and `export` phases in two separate submodules allows a
  dedicated team (think DevOps / SRE team) to control the export destinations, and
  delegate the ability to compute SLOs to each application team project.
  The `slo-generator` supports an all-in-one (compute + export) mode that allows
  it to be deployed on a single Cloud Function (see [`compact_example`](./examples/compact_example)).
