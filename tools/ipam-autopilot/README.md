# IPAM Autopilot
IPAM Autopilot is a simple Docker Container and Terraform provider that allows you to manage automatically manage IP ranges for GCP VPCs.

It connects to Cloud Asset Inventory to also retrieve already existing subnets and ranges, in order to allow for a mixed usage.

![Architecture showing Terraform, CloudRun, CloudSQL and Cloud Asset Inventory](./img/architecture.png "IPAM Autopilot Architecture")

IPAM Autopilot consists of two parts, a [backend service](./container) that provides a Rest API and a [terraform provider](./provider).

The provider uses application default credentials to authenticate against the backend.

## IPAM Autopilot Backend
The [infrastructure](./infrastructure) folder contains a sample Terraform setup with which the IPAM Autopilot backend can be deployed to CloudRun. It provisions a CloudSQL instance as well. The container is also build as part of this setup.

The following GCP services are used as part of the deployment, and might cause cost:
  * [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
  * [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)
  * [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)
  * [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)

The backend deployments contains a self-contained registry for discovery of the provider. Please be aware, this approach towards Terraform provider registry can be brittle.

## Deploying
In order to be able to use the provider later from terraform we need to provide the providers binaries in a way that Terraform can resolve them
For this we need to first build the providers binary. The Terraform deployment instructions will use the binaries to bundle the provider for discovery by the Terraform clients. For this you will need to have PGP set up so that the checksum file that accompanies the binaries can be signed.
You will also need to create a service account and download the key for this 

The infrastructure deployment takes the following variables, you can either set them via environment variables TF_VAR_<name> or in a .tfvars file.
| Variable                   	| Default Value   	| Description                                                                                                                                                	|
|----------------------------	|-----------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| project_id                 	|                 	| Project ID of the project to which the IPAM Autopilot should be deployed.                                                                                  	|
| sa_key                     	|                 	| Service Account JSON key file location. Used to create signed URLs for the provider files.                                                                 	|
| region                     	| europe-west1    	| GCP region that should contain the resources.                                                                                                              	|
| artifact_registry_location 	| europe          	| Location for the Artifact Registry location, containing the Docker container image for the IPAM Autopilot backend.                                         	|
| container_version          	| 1               	| Version of the container, since the container is build by the infrastructure automation, you can use this variable to trigger a new container image build. 	|
| provider_binary_folder     	| ../provider/bin 	| The folder relative to the infrastructure folder containing the binaries of the provider, is generated by `make release`                                   	|
| provider_version           	| 0.1.0           	| Version of the provider, needs to match the version in the Makefile                                                                                        	|

In order deploy, you will need to execute the following commands.

1. Build the Terrafrom provider by calling `make release` from the provider folder.
1. Deploy the infrastructure `terraform init` and `terraform apply`

## Setting up the local Terraform setup
In order to be able to download the provider from the CloudRun service, the Terraform CLI will need to authenticate against CloudRun. You will need to setup your `~/.terraformrc` file so that it conaints a valid identity token for a user with `roles/run.invoker`. You can obtain that token with `gcloud auth print-identity-token`.
```
credentials "<cloud run hostname>" {
  token = "<identity token>"
}
```

## An example configuration
Below is a Terraform example for using IPAM Autopilot
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ipam = {
      version = "0.1"
      source = "<cloud run hostname>/ipam-autopilot/ipam"
    }
  }
}

provider "ipam" {
  url = "https://<cloud run hostname>"
}

resource "ipam_ip_range" "pod-ranges" {
  range_size = 22
  name = "gke services range"
}

output "range" {
  value = ipam_ip_range.pod-ranges.cidr
}
```
