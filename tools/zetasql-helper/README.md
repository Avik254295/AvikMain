# ZetaSQL Helper

This project is currently a work in progress that will provide tools for
performing query analysis on BigQuery using 
[ZetaSQL](https://github.com/google/zetasql).

It currently includes the [ZetaSQL Toolkit](./zetasql-toolkit-core); a library
that helps users use ZetaSQL's Java API to perform SQL analysis for multiple 
query engines, including BigQuery.
