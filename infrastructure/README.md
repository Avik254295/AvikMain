### [dns-sync](dns-sync/README.md)
  Sync a Cloud DNS zone with GCE resources. Instances and load balancers are added to the cloud DNS zone as they start from compute_engine_activity log events sent from a pub/sub push subscription. Can sync multiple projects to a single Cloud DNS zone.

### [labelmaker](labelmaker/readme.md)
  _labelmaker.py_ is a tool that reads key:value pairs from a json file, and labels the running instance and all attached drives accordingly. It is designed to run on boot in a startup-script or userdata. Labels show up in billing exports to BigQuery, and allow organization to run complex cost analysis over their cloud spend.
