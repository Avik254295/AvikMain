  desc "A client certificate is a base64-encoded public certificate used by clients to authenticate to the cluster endpoint."
  desc "rationale", "If you disable client certificate generation to create a cluster without a client certificate. You will still be able to authenticate to the cluster with basic auth or IAM. But basic auth allows a user to authenticate to the cluster with a username and password which are stored in plain text without any encryption and might lead brute force attacks."
