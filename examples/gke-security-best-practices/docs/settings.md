| Number | Title | Description | Setting |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
|1|  Disable ABAC              | ABAC should be disabled and RBAC should be used |"  google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.enable_legacy_abac = ""false"""|
|2|  Disable Kubernetes Web UI (Dashboard) | The Kubernetes Dashboard is backed by a highly privileged Kubernetes Service Account.  The Cloud Console provides much of the same functionality so you don't need those permissions |" google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.kubernetes_dashboard.disabled = ""true"" "| 
|3| Restrict Traffic Amoung Pods        | Kubernetes network policies make it much more difficult for attackers to mover laterally within your cluster.  Since network policy is specific to your exact topology, we can't provide a specific recommendation.  The Kubernetes documentation however, has an excellent walkthrough for a simple nginx deployment | the google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.network_policy{} and google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.network_policy_config {}|
|4| Least Privilege Service Accounts for your Nodes     | Each GKE Node has an IAM Service account associated with it.  You should create and use a minimally privlidged service account to run your GKE Cluster instead of the Compute Engine Default Service Account |google_container_node_pool.regional_node_pool.service_account |
|5| Remove Oauth Scopes and set custom service account for nodes| Oauth Access scopes are a legacy method of specifying permissions for you instance.  Before the existance of IAM Roles, access scopes were the only mechanism for granting permissions to service accounts.  Creating a separate service account with IAM is the suggested best practices  | google_container_node_pool.regional_node_pool.oauth_scopes = [] | 
|6| Disable Authentication with a client certificate or username password | x509 certificates and username/passwords presents a wider surface of attack for cluster compromise than OpenID via gcloud|" google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.master_auth.username and google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.master_auth.password are set to """" "|
|7| Protect Node Metadata | Some practical attacks against k8s rely on access to VM's metadata server to extract node credentials.  You should disable legacy metadata server APIs and use metadata concealment to help protect potentially sensitive system metadata from workloads running on your cluster |" google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.workload_metadata_config.node_metadata = ""SECURE"" "| 
|8| Automatically Upgrade your Nodes | Kubernetes frequently introduces new security features and provides security patches.  Enabled node auto-upgrades ensures you automatically recieve upgrades and security patches for your node pool |"google_container_node_pool.regional_node_pool.management.auto_upgrade = ""true"" "|
|9| Pod Security Policy | By Default, Pods in Kubernetes can operate with capabilities beyond what they require.  You should contrain the Pod's capabilities to only thos required for that workload.  As the capabilities will vary by deployment we can not give specific guidance on this feautre.  However the restricted-psp.yaml example policy is a good starting point |" google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.pod_security_policy_config.enabled = ""true"" "| 
|10| Private Cluster Topology | By default all Nodes in the cluster have a public and private IP address, Publically accessible nodes present a wider attack surface.  As a best practice, Nodes should only be accessible via the private interface.  As a further layer of security, the master node's IP address can also be set to only be accessible via a private address.  Different Use Cases may require only the Nodes to be privately accessible and/or require the Master Node to also be only privately accessible |" google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.private_cluster_config.enable_private_nodes = ""true"". To enable private master: google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.private_cluster_config.enable_private_endpoint = ""true"""|
|11| Master Authorized Networks | If your use case requires the Master Node have a publicly routable address, the best practices is to add a subset of Authorized Networks to access the master nodes.  This allows only a subset of public IP address to access the Master Node and not the entire Internet ||
|12| Network Segmentation | Firewall rules should be in place in order to allow only the required ports / instances | google_compute_firewall.* | 
|13| Container-Optimized OS | The Container Optimized OS operating systems implements serveral advanced features for enhancing the security of Google Kubernetes Engine Clusters | google_container_node_pool.regional_node_pool.node_config.image_type |
|14| Binary Authorization | Binary Authorization is a service on GCP that provides software supply-chain security for applications.  You can ensure that intenral process that safegaurd the quality and integrity of your software have successfully completed before an application is deployed to your production environment |" google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.enable_binary_authorization = ""true"" "| 
|15| Audit Logging | Audit Logging provides a way for administrators to retain, query, process, and alert on events that occur in your GKE environments | google_container_cluster.regional-gke-container-cluster.logging_service |
